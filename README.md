## Print Multiplication Table

- **File:** `print_table.py`
- **Description:** Takes an input number from the user and prints its multiplication table.

## Generate Grade

- **File:** `generate_grade.py`
- **Description:** Defines a function `generate_grade` that determines the grade based on provided marks.

## Maximum of Three Numbers

- **File:** `max_of_three_numbers.py`
- **Description:** Finds the maximum of three numbers using a ternary operator.

## Average of N Positive Integers

- **File:** `average_of_n_numbers.py`
- **Description:** Takes an input `n` from the user and calculates the average of the first `n` positive integers.

## Sum of Positive Numbers

- **File:** `sum_of_positive_numbers.py`
- **Description:** Takes the number of inputs from the user, generates a list, and calculates the sum of positive numbers.

## Factorial

- **File:** `factorial.py`
- **Description:** Defines a function `find_factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number.

## List Operations
